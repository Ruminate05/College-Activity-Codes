		Among the many happenings of my 20 years of existence in this world, there are moments that I treasure and will forever remain in my memory.
		These are the unforgettable precious moments in my life.		
	</blockquote>
						
	<blockquote style="text-indent:5%;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
		First moment is our every year end family bonding during Christmas day. In particular , we got to eat outside while we have our quality time together 
		to talk without interruptions and worries. Together we spend our time relaxing and enjoying our day being complete as a family. During those times,
		I got to see my parents happy faces, my sisters bright smiles and I just feel like I'm lucky to have them in my life. Seeing my family every moment like that 
		in bliss makes me feel like I can go on and surpass struggles in life for them. As an oldest and only son in the family, they serve as my source of strength
		and washes away my worries and exhaustion from all of the horrible situations life put me into. Therefore, I ought to be a good man not only for myself 
		and my future but for them because they deserve to experience and have the precious things in life as they are precious for me as well. Every seconds of
		time spent with my family is diamond. What I feel with them is more than just a good laugh, I feel alive and genuinely loved. I won't ever trade 
		my complete, loving, and happy family over anything or anyone. I ought to treasure them as I treasure our moments, until my last breath,
		family is everything to me.

	<blockquote style="text-indent:5%;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
		Lastly, definitely I would not forget the year when I meet my love in Grade 12. 2018 is unforgettable year for me not just the moment 
		because specifically this was the year I court her. Plus the fact that two of us spent most of our time together doing school works 
		because she was studious. Everyday of my time with her is so precious to me. She's a positive influence to me, she enlightened me to see
		lights in darker paths and made my view in life even more wider and colorful. It's been 2 years, 5 months and 12 days ago since I bravely
		initiate myself to talk to her. For a fact, the most unforgettable moments of us together  is still increasing in number but the moments
		shown in the pictures are the best one's because these signifies the beginning of having "us".

		For my life lesson, I'll relate it with Albert Einstein quote,"You never fail until you stop trying".This saying hold various meanings for different 
		situations. For instance, during coding it is okay to commit mistakes because on that mistake, you will become more determined to solve that problem 
		rather than sitting and waiting for miracle and because of that you will learn a new knowledge. Moreover, you will not commit that mistake again
		because you learn something from it. For me, it is okay to fail as long as you will not stop trying. There are many things that you can learn from
		your mistakes. Therefore, you will never achieve something if you are doing nothing. In different situation, mistakes doesn't defined you as a failure,
		mistakes are made because you tried, you took risk and from that mistake you grew to become a better version of yourself. 
		Therefore,it is a wonderful thing to grow from your mistakes, it is better to keep trying than to stop and regret it at the end.
